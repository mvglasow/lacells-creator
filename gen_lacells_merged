#
#   Backup previous database and build new one.
#
#   Since Mozilla and OpenCellId have agreed to a common CSV format
#   we can use the same import logic for both. Buried in the SQL is
#   basically the following logic:
#   1. Import towers known to OpenCellId with weighted values
#   2. Import towers known to Mozilla with weighted values (will result in tower duplication)
#	3. Merge towers with weighted average values
#   4. Using MCC value(s), delete towers not in North America
#
#   DATA CLEANUP
#
#   The database for the whole world is fairly large, so the line:
#
#       DELETE FROM cells WHERE mcc != 310 AND mcc != 311;
#
#   Gets rid of stuff outside the United States. This can be removed if
#   towers for the whole world are desired. Or it can be modified to
#   select other countries as desired.
#
#   The opencellid database contains lots of towers with no coverage
#   range information (aproxy for accuracy). And due to sampling issues,
#   it is possible that low coverage range estimates are incorrect.
#
#   In addition, there are towers which have a coverage range reported
#   to be 1000s of KM which is probably incorrect and do not help on
#   locating the phone. So the expression:
#
#       min(max(range, 500),100000)
#
#   Is used to force each tower coverage range into the bounds of 0.5KM
#   to 100KM coverage range. These can be adjusted as needed but the
#   lower bound should be above zero to avoid divide by zero errors.
